# Swedish Nouns Can Be Very Long
_Author: Erik W. Gren_

## Combined Nouns

In English, we can find some _combined nouns_ such as "firefighter" (i.e. "fire" + "fighter").
However, the most common way of combining nouns in English is by using a space or a hyphens.

For example: _strategy game_, _forest fire_, _coffee mug_, _dog-friendly_, etc.

The Swedish approach to nouns is, however, a bit different. Swedish grammar thinks more along
the lines that a noun should be just that, _A_ noun. Hence, in Swedish, all combined nouns are
converted into one single, long noun.

## Examples
1. ::: good example
   Ett strategispel

   A strategy game
   :::
2. ::: good example
   En skogsbrand
   
   A forest fire
   :::
3. ::: bad example
   En skogs brand[^1]
   
   A forestfire
   :::

[^1]: The act of writing combined nouns incorrectly in Swedish is called **"s√§rskrivning"** (lit. separate writing).
    This is a common error for all Swedish beginners, native or not (Younger self included, of course).

## "En" or "Ett"?

Even though these long words technically should be studied as their own separate glossaries
(because they are), the rule of thumb is that the "last" word decides the noun's
n-ord/t-ord-property.

Let's look at the above example again:

::: good example
Ett strategispel

A strategy game
:::

"A strategy" is, in Swedish, "En strategi", whilst "a game" is "ett spel". Since the word
"spel" is at the end, and that it happens to be a t-ord, the noun itself becomes a t-ord.

If we were to change the order of the words...

::: good example
En spelstrategi

A game strategy
:::

...the noun would change into a n-ord since "strategy" happens to be a n-ord in Swedish.
