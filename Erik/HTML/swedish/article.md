# Swedish Nouns Can Be Very Long
*Author: Erik W. Gren*

## Combined Nouns
In English, we can find some *combined nouns* such as "firefighter" (i.e. "fire" + "fighter"). However, the most common way of combining nouns in English is by using a space or a hyphens.

For example: *strategy game*, *forest fire*, *coffee mug*, *dog-friendly*, etc.

The Swedish approach to nouns is, however, a bit different. Swedish grammar thinks more along the lines that a noun should be just that, *A* noun. Hence, in Swedish, all combined nouns are converted into one single, long noun.

## Examples
1. ::: good example
   Ett strategispel

   A strategy game
   :::
2. ::: good example
   En skogsbrand
   
   A forest fire
   :::
3. ::: bad example
   En skogs brand ^[The act of writing combined nouns incorrectly in Swedish is called **"särskrivning"** (lit. separate writing). This is a common error for all Swedish beginners, native or not (Younger self included, of course).]
   
   A forestfire
   :::
4. ::: good example
   Ett parkeringshus

   A parking house
   :::

## "En" or "Ett"?
Even though these long words technically should be studied as their own separate glossaries (because they are), the rule of thumb is that the "last" word decides the noun's
n-ord/t-ord-property.

Let's look at the above example again:

::: good example
Ett strategispel

A strategy game
:::

"A strategy" is, in Swedish, "En strategi", whilst "a game" is "ett spel". Since the word "spel" is at the end, and that it happens to be a t-ord, the noun itself becomes a t-ord.

If we were to change the order of the words...

::: good example
En spelstrategi

A game strategy
:::

...the noun would change into a n-ord since "strategy" happens to be a n-ord in Swedish.

## Is There a Limit?
Theoretically, a Swedish word could be infinitely long. Swedes usually gag about this fact by making extremely long and somewhat nonsensical words.

However, it would be ridiculous to have an infinitely long dictionary, so the SA has decided that the longest word in the official dictionary of the Swedish language (the SAOL/SAOB) is the following noun:
::: good example
Realisationskapitalvinstbeskattning ^[The crime of knowingly paying too little tax]

Realization-capital-gains-taxing (No English alternative)
:::

This word is not particularly useful nor common, but it is what it is.

## Those Weren't *Too* Bad
I promised you infinitely long words, and if that's what you want then that's what I will provide. Here are some extremely long words I've come across when joking with friends:

### Joke Examples
1. ::: good example
   Flaggstångsknoppsrengöringsmedel

   Flag-pole-top-cleaning-substance
   :::
2. ::: good example
   hyperneuroakustiska diafragmakontravibrationer ^[This is a scientific/joke word for "drunk hiccups". The more common term is "fyllehicka".]

   hyper-neuro-acoustic diaphragm-contra-vibrations
   :::
3. ::: good example
   Nagellackborttagningsmedelsradioreklam

   Nail-polish-remover-radio-advertisement
   :::
4. ::: good example
   Undervattensbåtseldsläckningspphängningskroksfäste

   Underwater-boat-fire-extinguish-hanger
   :::


## Extra
A challenge would be to try to decode all these words. I've tried my best to translate them word by word into English, though they might not be perfect.

If you feel like it, you can analyze these words thoroughly. (Though, if learning Swedish is your goal, it might be more effective to just move on to another article... )

But hey! Why would you learn Swedish if you can't have a bit of fun with it?
